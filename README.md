Hi there ðŸ‘‹
___

I am Aneta ðŸ¦‹ 

I started programming because I came to the conclusion that it is my **passion**, something that I can do with every free part of my time. I really like solving various problems related to the code and creating my own projects ðŸ¤“ The field of programming leaves me constantly mobilized to develop and invest new knowledge in myself! **I really enjoy coding!** 

ðŸ’¡ *Recently* I am working on a project that has quizzes where you can train your English. I thought about this it because I was learning English and I know that it is not easy to learn a foreign language. So I would like to create an application that will help other people learn the language faster and also have some fun learning it.

In the meantime, I've also done a few smaller projects. Here are links to them:

* Solar system: https://codesandbox.io/s/solar-system-forked-dd77v7
* Particle movement: https://codesandbox.io/s/particle-movement-forked-50qeo6?file=/index.html:82-99
* Colored balls: https://codesandbox.io/s/colored-balls-forked-lcl1ve?file=/index.html
* Game: https://codesandbox.io/s/game-forked-qq7z7g?file=/index.html
